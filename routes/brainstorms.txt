Authentications
Users
1. Ministers
2. Registered Members
3. Gepi Parters
4. Attendeees
5. First timers

Admins
1. Gepi-Admins
2. Biodata-Admins
3. Super-Admins
4. General Overseer



Requirements
1. Each users must be have their dashboard




Questions
1. Should I create different pages for the login pages?
or should it be the same Page?


Disadvantages
When you are admin you can't login as a user


Advantages
This ensures full package without stress integrated in a module.
if this can be properly done it makes things a lot easier.

Create dashboards for the Admins & the users and program them accordingly to their preferences

Users
1. Ministers  -done
2. Registered Members -done
3. Gepi Parters - done
4. Attendeees - done
5. First timers - not yet
                  First timers(This is more of a form to fill I will use google docs then use excel to import it to the users table)

Admin
1. Gepi-Admins
2. Biodata-Admins
3. Super-Admins
4. General Overseer


Duration: 2 hrs

So we have two main dashboards users and Admin
How do we identify the varieties of users we have?
No we don't need to identify we will find out by the following parameters 
1. Date joined, gepi_partnership_id, membership_status

For Admins, we find out by access-level




Step 1: Create a Page where users login as they would,
